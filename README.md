# Sticker quality control system
A computer vision system for automated quality control of sticker placement. The application detects objects on a conveyor belt, validates whether stickers are properly applied (presence, position, orientation, and size), and logs validation results for quality assurance reporting.

## Features
- Real-time sticker validation on conveyor belt
- Design configuration with user-friendly UI
- Validation logs and statistics
- Support for IP cameras and video files as input
- Interactive UI with notifications for user feedback
- Dynamic algorithms configuration without system restart

#### Input: IP camera or video file
The system starts with an IP camera, which captures real-time video or frames from video file as the input for further processing.

#### Backend
FastAPI acts as the central communication hub. Handles API requests/responses. Coordinates interaction between the core detection/processing system and external clients.
  
The system uses multiple processes for different CPU-bound stages of image processing: moving shape detection, shape processing, and sticker validation.
- ShapeDetector captures frames and uses background subtraction to detect moving objects on the conveyor belt
- ShapeProcessor extracts and transforms the regions of interest (detects batteries on conveyor belt, tracks sequence numbers of those)
- StickerValidator analyzes processed images to check for sticker presense and validates design and positioning according with provided parameters
Processes communicate validation data using queues. Configuration messages are sent using pipes.
  
#### Frontend
Provides graphical interfaces for different platforms: 
- Avalonia Desktop GUI for cross-platform native performance and rich UI.  
- Avalonia WebAssembly version allows the same interface to run in browsers.
- HTML/CSS/JS web interface (dashboard) that interacts with the FastAPI backend.

## Technologies Used
